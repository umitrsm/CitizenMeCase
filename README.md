 MVVM ROOM DAGGER RETROFIT LIVEDATA GLIDE

- I used a custom post object to be able to show post items and image of that item. I also recorded this Custom model to room.
Custom posts are available even if there is no internet connection.

- Placeholder images that we get from Api can't be loadded via Glide library
